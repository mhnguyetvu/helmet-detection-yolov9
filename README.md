# Helmet Detection using YOLOv9

## Overview

This project implements a real-time helmet detection system using the cutting-edge YOLOv9 object detection algorithm. The system is trained to identify two classes: "with helmet" and "without helmet" in images and videos. This initiative aims to enhance safety protocols by automatically monitoring helmet usage in environments like construction sites, manufacturing facilities, and other hazardous areas. By leveraging deep learning and computer vision techniques, this project provides a valuable tool for enforcing safety measures and reducing the risk of head injuries.

## 1. Setup

To run this project, you need to set up your environment. Follow these steps:

*   **Prerequisites:**
    *   **Python 3.8+** (Recommended Python version)
    *   **pip** (Python package installer)
    *   **GPU with CUDA/cuDNN** (Recommended for faster training and inference, but CPU can be used as well, albeit slower)

*   **Install Dependencies:**
    Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]  # Replace [repository-url] with the actual repository URL
    cd helmet-detection-yolov9
    ```
    Create a virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```
    Install the required Python libraries. We assume you have a `requirements.txt` file in the repository root. If not, you might need to install them based on the YOLOv9 implementation you are using (PyTorch and libraries like `torchvision`, `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `Pillow` are likely needed).
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

*   **Download YOLOv9 Implementation and Pre-trained Weights (if applicable):**
    This project utilizes YOLOv9.  You need to obtain the YOLOv9 implementation.  *(**Note:** Specific instructions here will depend on where you are getting the YOLOv9 code from.  If you are using a specific GitHub repository or framework, provide the download/clone instructions here.  If you are using a pre-existing YOLOv9 framework, link to it and explain where to place it in your project structure. You might also need to download pre-trained weights if you are fine-tuning or using them for initial inference. Provide instructions if necessary.)*

    **Example (Adapt based on your actual YOLOv9 source):**

    ```bash
    # Example if you are using a specific YOLOv9 GitHub repo (replace with actual URL)
    git clone [yolov9-implementation-repo-url] yolov9  # Clones YOLOv9 implementation into a 'yolov9' folder
    # Move necessary files from yolov9 into your project if needed, or adjust paths accordingly
    ```

    **Pre-trained weights:**  *(If you are using pre-trained weights, provide instructions to download them and where to place them. For example:)*

    > Download pre-trained YOLOv9 weights from [link-to-pretrained-weights] and place them in the `weights/` directory.

## 2. Dataset

This project is trained on a dataset of images annotated for helmet detection. The dataset is structured into two classes:

*   **with helmet**: Images containing individuals wearing helmets.
*   **without helmet**: Images containing individuals not wearing helmets.

The dataset is organized as follows:

*   **Images:** Located in the `images/` directory.
*   **Annotations:** Located in the `annotations/` directory.

*(**Describe your dataset in more detail here.  If it's a public dataset, link to it. If it's a custom dataset, explain how it was collected and annotated, without revealing sensitive details.  Mention the annotation format (e.g., YOLO format, Pascal VOC, COCO) if relevant.  If you have split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, describe the splits and directory structure.)**)*

**Example Dataset Description (Adapt to your dataset):**

> This project uses a custom dataset collected and annotated for helmet detection.  The dataset consists of images captured from [mention sources, e.g., public domain images, simulated environments, specific scenarios].  Annotations are in YOLO `.txt` format, where each annotation file corresponds to an image and contains bounding box coordinates and class labels for helmets (class 0) and no helmets (class 1).
>
> The dataset is split into:
> *   `images/train/` and `annotations/train/` for training
> *   `images/val/` and `annotations/val/` for validation
> *   `images/test/` and `annotations/test/` for testing (optional)

## 3. Usage

### Training

To train the YOLOv9 model on your helmet detection dataset, use the provided training script.

*(**Provide specific instructions on how to train the model. This will heavily depend on the YOLOv9 implementation you are using.  Mention the training script name, configuration files, dataset paths, and any command-line arguments needed. Example below is a placeholder.  Adapt this to your actual training process.)**)*

**Example Training Command (Adapt to your setup):**

```bash
python train.py --data data/helmet.yaml --cfg yolov9.yaml --weights yolov9_pretrained.pth --batch-size 16 --epochs 100
